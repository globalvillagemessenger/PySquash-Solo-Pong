This is a multiplayer game requiring two players.

Player 1 controls: w = up, s = down

Solo Pong, for those without friends! +1 points for hitting the ball, and +2 or +3 points if the ball
is moving at a higher speed. -1 points for failing to hit the ball. Surprisingly addictive! Written
in python with pygame. Also, the code is simple enough for a beginner to understand and learn from. Enjoy!
